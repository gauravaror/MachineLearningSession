In recent years word-embedding models have gained great popularity due to their remarkable performance on several tasks, including word analogy questions and caption generation. This shows that SkipGram embeddings are optimal in the sense of Globerson and Tishby and, further, implies that the heuristics commonly used to approximately fit Skip-Gram models can be used to fit SDR models. An unexpected “sideeffect” of such models is that their vectors often exhibit compositionality, i.e., adding two word-vectors results in a vector that is only a small angle away from the vector of a word representing the semantic composite of the original words, e.g., “man” + “royal” = “king”. This work provides a theoretical justification for the presence of additive compositionality in word vectors learned using the Skip-Gram model. Finally, this work establishes a connection between the Skip-Gram model and the Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) framework of Globerson and Tishby: the parameters of SDR models can be obtained from those of Skip-Gram models simply by adding information on symbol frequencies. As a corollary, it explains the success of vector calculus in solving word analogies. In particular, it shows that additive compositionality holds in an even stricter sense (small distance rather than small angle) under certain assumptions on the process generating the corpus. When these assumptions do not hold, this work describes the correct non-linear composition operator. . While our primary motivation has been to provide a better theoretical understanding of word compositionality in the popular Skip-Gram model, our connection with the SDR method illuminates a much more general point about the practical applicability of the Skip-Gram model. . This can be verified by calculation:
qŨ,Ṽ(c) = ∑ w qŨ,Ṽ(w, c)∑ w,t qŨ,Ṽ(w, t) = ∑ w e uTc vw+αc ∑ w,t e uTt vw+αt

have
qŨ,Ṽ(c) =
[ (eUV T 1) eα ] c
1T [ (eUV T 1) eα ] = gc∑ t gt = gc. In this work we focus on explaining the source of this phenomenon for the most prominent such model, namely the Skip-Gram model introduced in (Mikolov et al., 2013a). Globerson and Tishby show that such optimal features can be obtained from a low-rank factoriza-

ij Gij normalizes G into an estimate of the joint pmf of X and Y , and similarly ZW,H is the constant that normalizes eWH T into a joint pmf. This connection is significant for two reasons: first, the original algorithm of (Globerson and Tishby, 2003) for learning SDR embeddings is expensive, as it involves information projections. An alternative to seeking word-embeddings that reflect co-occurrence statistics is to extract the vectorial representation of words from non-linear statistical language models, specifically neural networks. . We now show that the augmented matrices W = Ũ and H = Ṽ also minimize this second term, and in addition they make the first term vanish. Recall that uC = ∑m

so the matrices U and V that are returned by fitting the Skip-Gram model minimize the second term in this sum. Minimizing the angle has been empirically successful at capturing composition in multiple loglinear word models. 1 Introduction  The strategy of representing words as vectors has a long history in computational linguistics and machine learning. . , cm) = p(w|c) . For any given set of words C = {c1, . First, assume that m = ∆. must satisfy
∑ `∈V p(`|m)v` = ∑ `∈V p(`|w,R)v` and
∑ `∈V p(`|k)v` = ∑ `∈V p(`|?, R)v`. Lemma 1. . The Skip-Gram model learns vector representations of words based on their patterns of co-occurrence in the training corpus as follows: it assigns to each word c in the vocabulary V , a “context” and a “target” vector, respectively uc and vc, which are to be used in order to predict the words that appear around each occurrence of c within a window of ∆ tokens. . The choice W = Ũ and H = Ṽ makes the first term in (9) vanish, and it also minimizes the second term in (9). Theorem 1. Applying Baye’s rule,

An unexpected side effect of deriving wordembeddings via neural networks is that the wordvectors produced appear to enjoy (approximate) additive compositionality: adding two wordvectors often results in a vector whose nearest word-vector belongs to the word capturing the composition of the added words, e.g., “man” + “royal” = “king” (Mikolov et al., 2013c). That is, SDR emphasizes fitting the entire pmfs, while Skip-Gram emphasizes fitting conditional distributions. Since Theorem 1 holds for any prior over V , in theory, we could enumerate all words in V and
find the word(s) that minimize the difference of the left hand side of (7) from the right hand side. . There is empirical evidence that this model generates features that are useful for NLP tasks, but there is no a priori guarantee that the training corpus was generated in this manner. . .

p(ci|w). Since Q is concave, the maximizers occur where its gradient vanishes. Finally, the discourse vector is assumed to evolve according to a random walk on the unit sphere that has a uniform stationary distribution. In fact, the connection we establish between the Skip-Gram and the Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction model of (Globerson and Tishby, 2003) shows that the word vectors learned by Skip-Gram are information-theoretically optimal. Instead, a paraphrase c is a vector such that the average word vector under p(·|c) matches that under p(·|C). share the same relationship means k is a paraphrase of the set of words {?, R}. This shows that SkipGram embeddings are optimal in the sense of Globerson and Tishby and, further, implies that the heuristics commonly used to approximately fit Skip-Gram models can be used to fit SDR models. Then, the features (Ũ, Ṽ) constitute a sufficient dimensionality reduction of G.
Proof. In more sophisticated methods cooccurrences are reweighed to suppress the effect of more frequent words (Rohde et al., 2006) and/or to emphasize pairs of words whose co-occurrence frequency maximally deviates from the independence assumption (Church and Hanks, 1990). This approach came into prominence recently through works of Mikolov et al. That said, we feel it is important to point out that, as reported in (Mikolov et al., 2013b), additivity captures compositionality more accurately when the training set is manipulated so that the prior distribution of the words is made closer to uniform. Finally, we explain how linear compositionality allows for solving word analogies with vector algebra. Thus,∇Q(uC) = 0 and since Q is concave, uC is its unique maximizer. The peaks of this categorical distribution are precisely the words with which c co-occurs most often. . It is known that learning model parameters by maximum likelihood estimation is equivalent to minimizing the KL-divergence of the learned model from the empirical distribution; the following lemma establishes the KL-divergence that Skip-Gram minimizes.

This work provides a theoretical justification for the presence of additive compositionality in word vectors learned using the Skip-Gram model. This implies that Skip-Gram specific approximation heuristics like negativesampling, hierarchical softmax, and Glove, which are believed to return high-quality approximations to Skip-Gram parameters (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Pennington et al., 2014), can be used to efficiently approximate SDR model parameters. In the Skip-Gram model target words are conditionally independent given a context word, i.e.,
p(c1, . , cm}, any paraphase c of C satisfies
∑ w∈V p(w|c)vw = ∑ w∈V p(w|C)vw . To establish this result, we use a chain rule for the KL-divergence. When these assumptions do not hold, this work describes the correct non-linear composition operator. 2.1 Proofs  Proof of Theorem 1. We see that solving analogies when the composition operator is nonlinear requires the solution of two highly nonlinear systems of equations. In particular, it shows that additive compositionality holds in an even stricter sense (small distance rather than small angle) under certain assumptions on the process generating the corpus. Let U,V be the results of fitting a Skip-Gram model to G, and consider the augmented matrices

Theorem 1 characterizes the composition operator for any language model which satisfies our two assumptions; in general, this operator is not addition. To see that the first of these claims holds, i.e., that the augmented matrices make the second term in (9) vanish, note that
qŨ,Ṽ(w|c) ∝ eũ T c ṽw = eu T c vw+αc ∝ qU,V(w|c),
and the constant of proportionality is independent of w. It follows that qŨ,Ṽ(w|c) = qU,V(w|c) and
DKL(Ĝ ‖ qŨ,Ṽ(w|c)) = DKL(Ĝ ‖ qU,V(w|c)). , cm}, there exists ZC such that for every word w,

corpora) afforded by (the more restricted class of) log-linear models. Theorem 3 shows that if one can efficiently fit a Skip-Gram model, then one can efficiently fit an SDR model. In this section, we provide theoretical support for the usefulness of the features learned even when the SkipGram model is misspecified. Whereas the SDR objective measures the distance between the pmfs given by (normalized versions of) G and eWH T , the SkipGram objective measures the distance between the pmfs given by (normalized versions of) the rows of G and eWH T . In the simplest case, one seeks vectors whose inner products approximate the co-occurrence frequencies. Second, (Globerson and Tishby, 2003) argues for the optimality of the SDR embedding in any domain where the training information on X and Y consists of their coocurrence statistics; this optimality and the Skip-Gram/SDR connection argues for the use of Skip-Gram approximations in such domains, and supports the positive experimental results that have been observed in applications in network science (Grover and Leskovec, 2016), proteinomics (Asgari and Mofrad, 2015), and other fields. .+ um . is in terms of k, w, andm, there is actually no need to assume that R is a set of actual words in V . Before presenting our main result, we state and prove the following lemma, which is of independent interest and is used in the proof of our main theorem. . . A key insight in that regard is to posit that the meaning of a word is captured by “the company it keeps” (Firth, 1957) and, therefore, that two words that keep company with similar words are likely to be similar themselves. (3)
As mentioned, the normalized context vectors obtained from maximizing (3) under (1) and (2) exhibit additive compositionality. . The expression eWH T

we again begin with the assertion that the fact that m and w share a relationship means m is a paraphrase of the set of words {w,R}; Similarly, k is a paraphrase of {?, R}. Specifically, the word vectors must be known a priori, before their recovery, and to have been generated by randomly scaling uniformly sampled vectors from the unit sphere1. Thus, the choice W = Ũ and H = Ṽ minimizes the second term in (9). As a corollary, it explains the success of vector calculus in solving word analogies. + ur,

it is clear that if the angle between the context representations of c and c′ is small, the distributions p(w|c) and p(w|c′) will tend to have similar peaks.

We refer to any vector that minimizes (4) as a paraphrase of the set of words C.
There are two natural concerns with (4). In sharp contrast, when the composition operator is linear, the solution of analogies delightfully reduces to elementary vector algebra. . Here, the notation x y denotes entry-wise multiplication of vectors. By way of contrast, our results assume nothing a priori about the properties of the word vectors. Whilst vector-similarity can be readily quantified in terms of distances and angles, quantifying word-similarity is a more ambiguous task. Although this is an intuitively satisfying definition, we never expect it to hold exactly; instead, we replace exact equality with the minimization of KL-divergence. Further, the ith word in the corpus must have been selected with probability proportional to eu T wci , where the “discourse” vector ci governs the topic of the corpus at the ith word. Proof of Lemma 1. We prove that it also satisfies A2 when m ≤ ∆ (Lemma 1). This work guarantees that word vectors can be recovered by factorizing the so-called PMI matrix, and that algebraic operations on these word vectors can be used to solve analogies, under certain conditions on the process that generated the training corpus. . (Bengio et al., 2003) already proposed (i) associating with each vocabulary word a feature vector, (ii) expressing the probability function of word sequences in terms of the feature vectors of the words in the sequence, and (iii) learning simultaneously the vectors and the parameters of the probability function. . One way to understand the success of this approach is to recall that each word c is characterized by a categorical distribution over all other words w, as stated in (1). In every word model that satisfies A1 and A2, for every set of words C = {c1, . . For example, the cosine distance between the sum of the context vectors of the words “Vietnam” and “capital” and the context vector of the word “Hanoi” is small. The Skip-Gram model satisfies assumption A2 when m ≤ ∆. That is, we state that the best candidate for having the same meaning as the set of context words C is the word
arg min c∈V
DKL(p(·|C) | p(·|c)) . Projection of paraphrases onto the vocabulary Theorem 2 states that if there is a word c in the vocabulary V whose context vector equals the sum of the context vectors of the words c1, . In Theorem 3 below, we show that if a SkipGram model is fit to the cooccurence statistics of X and Y , then the output can be trivially modified (by adding readily-available information on word frequencies) to obtain the parameters of an SDR model. Even if we are making reasonable linguistic assumptions about how to model words and the interdependencies of words in a corpus, it’s not clear that these have to hold universally on all corpuses to which we apply Skip-Gram. Finally, this work establishes a connection between the Skip-Gram model and the Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) framework of Globerson and Tishby: the parameters of SDR models can be obtained from those of Skip-Gram models simply by adding information on symbol frequencies. Our main result shows that both of these problems go away for any language model that satisfies the following two assumptions:
A1. Importantly, this statement requires no assumptions on the distribution P (X,Y ). . , cm has the same meaning as the single word c if for every other word w,
p(w|c1, . As word frequencies are typically much closer to a Zipf distribution (Piantadosi, 2014), the uniformity assumption of Theorem 2 is not realistic. , cm)vw ,
we see that (7) follows. This establishes the result when m = ∆. In practice, it turns out that the angle between the context vector of a word w ∈ V and solutionvector(s) is a good proxy and one gets very good experimental results by selecting as the paraphrase of a collection of words, the word that minimizes the angle to the paraphrase vector. (6)
Clearly, the Skip-Gram model satisfies A1 by definition. The general idea is to find a map from words to vectors such that wordsimilarity and vector-similarity are in correspondence. , w∆|c) = ∆∏

p(wδ|c). These words characterize c more than all the other words in the vocabulary, so it is reasonable to expect that a word c′ whose categorical distribution has similar peaks as the categorical distribution of c is similar in meaning to c. Note that the location of the peaks of p(·|c) are immune to the scaling of uc (athough the values of p(·|c) may change); thus, the wordsw which best characterize c are those for which vw has a high inner product with uc/‖uc‖2. , cm}, it is unlikely that there exists a word c ∈ V whose context vector is exactly equal to the sum of the context vectors of the words c1, . 3 Skip-Gram learns a Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction Model  The Skip-Gram model assumes that the distribution of the neighbors of a word follows a specific exponential parametrization of a categorical distribution. Next, we state a theorem that holds for any model satisfying assumptions A1 and A2, including the Skip-Gram model when m ≤ ∆. Thus, it follows that the features (Ũ, Ṽ) constitute a sufficient dimensionality reduction of G. Recall that Skip-Gram chooses U and V to maximize

1More generally, it suffices that the word vectors have certain properties consistent with this sampling process. This unexpected property allows one to use these vectors to answer word-analogy questions algebraically, e.g., answering the question “Man is to king as woman is to ” by returning the word whose word-vector is nearest to the vector
v(king) - v(man) + v(woman). (2)
(Mikolov et al., 2013a) proposed learning the Skip-Gram parameters on a training corpus by using maximum likelihood estimation under (1) and (2). We first consider solving an analogy of the form “m:w::k:?”” in the case where the composition operator is nonlinear. Further, the context word c in the Skip-Gram model essentially serves the role that the discourse vector does in the PMI model of (Arora et al., 2016): the words neighboring c are selected with probability proportional to eu T c vw . In both cases, we thus need to project the vector(s) onto words in our vocabulary in some manner. . It has been observed that word vectors trained using nonlinear models like Skip-Gram tend to encode semantic relationships between words as linear relationships between the word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Pennington et al., 2014; Levy and Goldberg, 2014). The SDR model
learns optimal2 embeddings for discrete random variables X and Y without assuming any parametric form on the distributions of X and Y , and it is useful in a variety of applications, including information retrieval, document classification, and association analysis (Globerson and Tishby, 2003). . When the expectations in (7) can be computed, the composition operator can be implemented by solving a non-linear system of equations to find a vector u for which the left-hand side of (7) equals the right-hand side. . As stated above, the SDR factorization solves the problem of finding information-theoretically optimal features, given co-occurrence statistics for a pair of discrete random variables X and Y . Similarly, in Theorem 1, the solution(s) to (7) will most likely not equal the context vector of any word in V . Theorem 2. . , cm)‖p(·|c))

Our next result proves that although the composition operator is nontrivial in the general case, to recover vector addition as the composition operator, it suffices to assume that the word frequency is uniform. Let G be the word co-occurrence matrix constructed from the corpus on which a SkipGram model is trained, in which case Gcw is the number of times word w occurs as a neighboring word of c in the corpus. For each word c, let gc denote the empirical frequency of the word in the corpus, so that

While there has been much interest in using algebraic operations on word vectors to carry out semantic operations like composition, and mathematically-flavored explanations have been offered (e.g., in the recent work (Paperno and Baroni, 2016)), the only published work which attempts a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon is (Arora et al., 2016). Theorems 1 and 2 offer insight into the solution such analogy questions. (5)

Recall that Skip-Gram represents each word c as a multinomial distribution over all other words w, and it learns the parameters for these distributions by a maximum likelihood estimation. Now we revisit the Skip-Gram training objective, and show that it differs from the SDR objective only slightly. , cm)

To see that the augmented matrices make the first term in (9) vanish, observe that when W = Ũ and H = Ṽ, we have that qŨ,Ṽ(c) = g by construction. A natural way of capturing the compositionality of words is to say that the set of context words c1, . The fact that m and w share a relationship means m is a paraphrase of the set of words {w,R}, whereR is a set of words encoding the relationship between m and w. Similarly, the fact that k and ?

when W = Ũ and H = Ṽ. Note that because this expression for u? The first is that, in general, it is not clear how to define p(·|C). As it turns out, these embeddings, like Skip-Gram, are obtained by learning the parameters of an exponentially parameterized distribution. Under a single simplifying assumption, the operator linearizes and reduces to the addition of the word vectors. However, the fact that when we fit a Skip-Gram model we are fitting an SDR model (up to frequency information), and the fact that SDR models are information-theoretically optimal in a certain sense, argues that regardless of whether the Skip-Gram assumptions hold, Skip-Gram always gives us optimal features in the following sense: the learned context embeddings and target embeddings preserve the maximal amount of mutual information between any pair of random variablesX and Y consistent with the observed co-occurence matrix, where Y is the target word and X is the predictor word (in a min-max sense, since there are many ways of coupling X and Y , each of which may have different amounts of mutual information).

Further, Skip-Gram assumes that the conditional probability of each possible set of words in a window around a context word c factorizes as the product of the respective conditional probabilities:
